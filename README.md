## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Will!


Welcome to my GitHub profile!  I am a multi-disciplinary scientist with a varied background including as a research chemist in the chemical coatings industry and as a wildlife ecologist studying population genetics of bobcats.  Now, I am furthering my journey into the data realm, building on my past expertise in R and Excel and incorporating new skills in Python and SQL. I look forward to showcasing my past, present, and future projects here to demonstrate the breadth of subjects I have contributed to.
